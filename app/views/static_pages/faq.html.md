### About the DMPTool

##### Q: What is a data management plan (DMP)?  
A: A data management plan is a formal document that outlines what you will do with your data during and after a research project. Most researchers collect data with some form of plan in mind, but it's often inadequately documented and incompletely thought out. Many data management issues can be handled easily or avoided entirely by planning ahead. With the right process and framework it doesn't take too long and can pay off enormously in the long run.


Read our [Data Management General Guidelines](https://dmptool.org/dm_guidance) for more information about DMPs.
***

##### Q: What can I do with the DMPTool?  
A: The DMPTool helps researchers create data management plans (DMPs). It provides guidance from specific funders who require DMPs, but the tool can be used by anyone interested in developing generic DMPs to help facilitate their research. The tool also offers resources and services available at [partner institutions](https://dmptool.org/partners_list) to help fulfill your data management requirements. 


Use our [Quick Start Guide](https://dmptool.org/quickstartguide/) to begin creating a plan.
***

##### Q: How much does it cost to use the DMPTool?  
A: The DMPTool is FREE. Anyone can create data management plans using the DMPTool. 


A login is required to access the DMPTool. If you are a researcher from a [partner institution](https://dmptool.org/partners_list), you can log in as a user from your institution. If your institution is not a partner, you can create your own account. 


Use our [Quick Start Guide](https://dmptool.org/quickstartguide/) to begin creating a plan.
***

##### Q: Who can use the DMPTool?  
A: Anyone can create data management plans. If you are a researcher from one of the [partner institutions](https://dmptool.org/partners_list), you can log in as a user from your institution. By being affiliated with your institution, you will be presented with institution-specific guidance (displayed as resource links tab) to help you complete your plan. 


If your institution is not a partner, you can create your own account by selecting “Not in List” as your institution upon login. 


Use our [Quick Start Guide](https://dmptool.org/quickstartguide/) to begin creating a plan.
***

##### Q: How can my institution become a DMPTool partner?  
A: First, check this [list](https://dmptool.org/partners_list) to make sure your institution is not already a partner. Learn more about becoming a [partner institution](https://dmptool.org/partners).


If you are a researcher or potential user, we suggest you talk to a librarian at your institution. If you are an administrator (librarian or otherwise) and interested in joining, please contact us at [uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu)
***

##### Q: What are the benefits of becoming a DMPTool partner?  
A: Partner institutions can incorporate information about their resources and services to aid researchers with data management. Partner institutions can also provide customized help and suggest answers to the questions asked by funding agencies. Users from partner institutions that have configured the tool with Shibboleth can log in with their own institutional accounts. 


For more information, see https://dmptool.org/partners.
***

##### Q: Have funders endorsed the DMPTool?  
A: No funders have endorsed the use of the DMPTool, although some provide links to the tool or resources within the tool in their public access plans (e.g., NEH, DOT). 


Despite the lack of formal endorsements, the DMPTool templates incorporate specific data management planning requirements from a range of funders including foundations and government agencies. We are in close contact with some funders as we create templates and for all funders we monitor public notices and websites for changes. 
***

##### Q: Who owns the data management plans created with the DMPTool?  
A: Data management plans are the intellectual property of their creators. The California Digital Library makes no claim of copyright or ownership to the data management plans created using the DMPTool. You can, however, choose to share your plan publicly and it will appear in our library of [public DMPs](https://dmptool.org/public_dmps) on the DMPTool website. This will benefit other DMPTool users and promote open research. 


See the [Quick Start Guide](https://dmptool.org/quickstartguide/) for more information on setting your plan's visibility.
***

##### Q: Why am I getting email notifications from the DMPTool?   
A: There are multiple actions that generate automatic email notifications from the DMPTool. Users can turn these notifications on/off on the dashboard. Navigate to the "My Profile" tab, then the "Notification Preferences" tab, and check/uncheck the appropriate boxes.
***

### For Researchers


##### Q: I'm in a hurry! Is there a quick start guide for creating a DMP?  
A: Yes! The [Quick Start Guide](https://dmptool.org/quickstartguide/) is available as a website or a PDF you can download.
***

##### Q: Are there examples of data management plans?  
A: The DMPTool hosts a collection of [public data management plans](https://dmptool.org/public_dmps).
The collection contains actual plans created by DMPTool users who have opted to share their plans publicly. Please note that these plans have not been vetted for quality. Some funders provide sample plans on their websites; links to these plans are available on the [DMP Requirements page](https://dmptool.org/guidance).
***

##### Q: What's the difference between “sample” and “public” DMPs?  
A: The sample plans on the [DMP Requirements page](https://dmptool.org/guidance) are created by funders and offered as guidance on their websites. The [Public DMPs](https://dmptool.org/public_dmps) are actual plans created by users of the DMPTool (please note that these have not been vetted for quality). Both provide helpful examples for researchers creating their own data management plans.
***

##### Q: What are the visibility options for my DMP?   
A: There are three visibility options for each plan you create:   
1. Private. This is the default setting. Your plan will only be visible to you and your plan co-owners.  
2. Institutional. If your institution is a DMPTool partner, this setting allows administrators and users from your institution to see your plan.  
3. Public. It will be available on the [Public DMPs](https://dmptool.org/public_dmps) section of the DMPTool website. Choose this option to allow others to see your plan without restrictions (under a CC-Zero license).   
***

##### Q: I created a test plan. How can I delete it (or hide it)?   
A: 1. Log into the DMPTool.  
2. Select "My DMPs" from the navigation bar.  
3. Hover over the name of the test DMP you created.  
4. To delete the plan: click Delete. You will be asked to confirm this action.   
5. To change the plan's visibility so it is no longer public: click Share and select the "Private" radio button.  
***

##### Q: How long will you save my plans?  
A: We do not plan to delete any plans created with the DMPTool. As a plan owner, however, you can delete plans by going to “My Dashboard” and selecting “Delete” next to the plan name.
***

##### Q: What if I move to a new institution?   
A: Since the DMPTool account is tied to an email address, the information will not automatically follow a user if they change institutions. However, we can connect users to their plans from previous institutions if they contact us. Users who change institutions and assume new institutional credentials must create a new DMPTool account. 
***

##### Q: Who can help me at my institution?  
A: If your institution is a [DMPTool partner](https://dmptool.org/partners_list), you can log into the tool and click on the “Contact Institution Administration” link in the top banner. Your email will be sent directly to the DMP expert on your campus who can follow up with you. If your institution is not a DMPTool partner, check with a librarian to see if someone on campus can help. Alternatively, you can email us with questions at [uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu)
***

##### Q: I have a collaborator. How can we work on the same plan?  
A: First both of you must create accounts in the DMPTool. Then you simply add your collaborator(s) to your plan as a co-owner(s). You can do this on the “DMP Overview” page. Click “Add” and locate your collaborator by email address. 


For more information, see the [Quick Start Guide](https://dmptool.org/quickstartguide/).
***

##### Q: What does it mean to have a plan “reviewed”?  
A: The review functionality of the DMPTool is an optional feature that institutions may configure to help researchers create data management plans. Note: review functionality is NOT connected to any funders currently. Submitting a plan for review is within-institution only.

Administrators: if you are interested in enabling review functionality for users at your institution, see the [Review](Review-Functionality) section of the help wiki. 
***

##### Q: Where can I read more about funder requirements for DMPs?  
A: The [DMP Requirements page](https://dmptool.org/guidance) provides direct links to funder guidelines, as well as sample plans if provided. You do not have to be logged into the DMPTool to access this page.
***

### For Administrators

##### Q: Where can I find help customizing the DMPTool for my institution?  
A: There is an extensive list of [help topics for administrators](Help-for-Administrators) configuring the DMPTool located on GitHub. In the future, we plan to enable users to view customizations created by other institutions.
***

##### Q: How do I create a DMP template for my multi-institution group or project?  
A: Any template created by an administrator of any institution can be made publicly available. Simply select "Public" visibility on the template overview. We do ask that you consult with the DMPTool team before activating a public template to review it for consistency with existing template standards. 

To create a public template, follow the instructions in the [help documentation](Creating-Templates-for-Multi-Institution-Use).
***

##### Q: I created a test template. How can I delete it?   
A: DMPTool administrators (including template editors and institutional reviewers) can delete templates. This option is only available if no DMPs have been created using that template. If you cannot or do not want to delete a template, you can make the template “Inactive” so that it will not appear to users. See our [help documentation](Template-creation#activating-and-deactivating-a-template) on how to do this.


Note that when you delete a template, other resources attached to that template and no other will also be deleted (e.g., Customizations, Funder Links).
***

##### Q: How do I format guidance?  
A: You can add formatting to the customization view for DMP templates by including HTML tags.
