msgid "A: A data management plan is a formal document that outlines what you will do with your data during and after a research project. Most researchers collect data with some form of plan in mind, but it's often inadequately documented and incompletely thought out.

msgid "Tabular data warrants special mention because it is so common across disciplines, mostly as Excel spreadsheets. If you do your analysis in Excel, you should use the \"Save As...\" command to export your work to .csv format when you are done. Your spreadsheets will be easier to understand and to export if you follow best practices when you set them up, such as:<ul><li>Don\\'t put more than one table on a worksheet</li><li>Include a header row with understandable title for each column</li><li>Create charts on new sheets- don\\'t embed them in the worksheet with the data</li></ul>"

msgid "The original DMPTool was a grassroots effort, beginning in 2011 with eight institutions partnering to provide in-kind contributions of personnel and development. The effort was in direct response to demands from funding agencies, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, that researchers plan for managing their research data. By joining forces the contributing institutions were able to consolidate expertise and reduce costs in addressing data management needs. Representatives from these institutions participate on the <a href=\\"%{steering_committee_url}\\">DMPTool Steering Committee</a> that maintains monthly calls."
